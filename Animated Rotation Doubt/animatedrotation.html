        </div>
        <div style="width: 800px;">
          <h2 style="font-weight: 400;">After setting the "animation-fill-mode" to alternate for the parent div it can be seen that the child element rotates <u>twice as fast</u> than specified when in direction of the parent div
          , but <u>stays still</u> when the parent changes its direction.<br><br>This leads me to believe that for the child, both its parent's and its own animation happen at the same time (internal calculation for position for the next frame)
          which is maybe why it's twice as fast when in the same direction as of parent and still when opposing.<br><br>This may also be the reason that the child div performs more than (if)specified finite iterations.
